					<h2 class="title">Project: GitHub Data Challenge</h2>
					<div id="intro"><p>A data analytics project aimed to study the popularity of several thousands GitHub's repositories.</p></div>
					<div class="project-descr">
						<h1>GitHub Data Challenge</h1>
						<a href=""><img src="http://events.lvtran.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/git.jpeg" alt="git" width="200" height="200" style="margin-right:15px; float:left;"/></a>
						<p>GitHub Data Challenge is a data analytics project aimed to make sense of millions of data points gathered from all the repositories hosted on github.com. GitHub is a known to be the home of thousands of sophisticated and widely-known repositories. That leaves my partner and I wonder what factors have attributed to their successes.</p>
						<h3>The Questions</h3>
						<p>Hacker News, a very popular social news website catered to programmers and entrepreneurs, often contains posts that are linked to GitHub repositories, most of which are very popular. <br><br>How does linking a GitHub repository on HackerNews change its popularity? Is there such thing as ‘the HackerNews popularity bump’ ?<br><br><img src="http://events.lvtran.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-26-at-11.19.26-AM-1024x591.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-08-26 at 11.19.26 AM" width="465" height="268" style="float:right;"/>Those are the questions we want to answer after this project. We want to determine if being mentioned on Hacker News significantly contributes to a repository’s popularity and if so, by how much. Popularity is defined as the raw number of ‘stars’ a particular repository has. To answer this ‘simple’ binary question, we studied the growth rate of each of the 1.5 millions repositories a week before and after the date it was mentioned on Hacker News, if it was mentioned at all. We repeated this process for all repositories to find the average. </p>
						<h3>tl;dr</h3>
						<h1>INSERT GRAPH</h1>
						<p>HackerNews increases the rate of growth in number of stars for the repo by 38.15%. The percentage increase varies depending on your repository’s number of stars and your HackerNews post’s upvotes.<br><br>The graph contains data that only matches with the constraints on the sliders. The red line shows the daily percentage increase in the number of stars for the week before and after the HackerNews mention. The blue line shows the daily percentage increase in the number of stars for all repositories in the week surrounding the expected date of mention.</p>
						<h3>Understanding tl;dr</h3>
						<p>The sliders control the two searching constraints: number of  upvotes of a HackerNews post and number of stars of a linked GitHub repository. They represent different tiers of the data. This is because there is a large disparity in the effects on a 50,000-star repository as opposed to a 50-star one. The HackerNews upvotes slider determines the upvotes needed to create the “popularity bump”. Note that the repositories that have not been mentioned on HackerNews are not constrained by this slider. <br><br>The red line represents the percentage growth in stars each day. This is calculated by the generic growth formula. For instance, if a repository has 100 stars today and 120 stars tomorrow, the growth is (120 - 100)/100 = 20%. The data was processed and visualized this way instead of using the raw number of stars. This is because we found the data to be too far skewed when some repositories have a huge number of stars (cough cough Twitter’s Bootstrap). <br><br>The blue line represents the expected growth of a GitHub repository without being mentioned on HackerNews. This is extremely useful in determining whether HackerNews has any effect at all. The data included here is not the 15 day outlook, but rather an expected growth without any effect from HackerNews.</p>
						<h3>Obtaining Data</h3>
						<p>To gather information about the popularity of repositories over time, we attempted to recreate a timeline of all GitHub events useful for this study (i.e when a user starring a repository). Unfortunately, these data was not readily available to download; they had to be obtained from alternative data sources. There were 3 options available:
						<br>-GitHub’s native API: a typical API hosted by GitHub
						<br>-Google BigQuery: a RESTful API enabling analysis of massive datasets
						<br>-GitHub Archive: an open-source project by Google's <a href="https://github.com/igrigorik" target="_blank">Ilya Grigorik</a>. <br>
						All of these data sources provided enough information needed for our study. However, we ran into a few hiccups along the way. <br><br>We first tried gathering data from GitHub’s native API by using a Python script and a REST library. Getting the correct queries and responses from the GitHub API requests was fairly simple. The only fallback we could see with this approach was the 10,000 API calls per hour, until we saw discrepancies in the data we got back: we did not see the entire events history for some extremely popular repositories. We later found out that this was due to ‘pagination limit’. This meant if the history of a repository spanned across 10 pages, we would only be able to see up to the 10th page. We did not know how to work around this problem, so we turned to the next data source option, Google BigQuery.<br>
						<img src="http://events.lvtran.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-26-at-11.36.59-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-08-26 at 11.36.59 AM"/>Google BigQuery really blew us away with its computing power. It could crunch through gigabytes of data in a matter of seconds. The only thing it needed was a SQL-like query. The data could be downloaded in JSON or CSV format once the queries completed. This source proved to be ideal until we found out that the computing power we needed would cost more than ‘Free’. Moving on.<br><br>The last data source option was GitHub Archive. After finding a Ruby script example, we tweaked the script to download all the data files to process later on. However, the files were in GZIP format, a compression form used to store large files on the web. We had to do more tweaking to do the Ruby script to unzip and read the GZIP files, since Python could not finish this particular task. All the events history data could finally be obtained.</p>
						<h3>Analyzing Data</h3>
						<p>Once all the data was collected and stored in 360 GB worth of JSON, we thought reading from each file to process do the calculation was just a few steps away. Little did we know reading through gigabytes of data would take as long as 5 hours per repository. Our research led to the use of mySQL database, which seemed to provide a more promising lookup time. A Python script read from all the JSON files, collected relevant information, and stored them into a local mySQL database. This one-time process took as long as 7 and a half hours on a MacBook Pro.
						<br><br>Storing relevant data to a mySQL database improved lookup speed significantly. We could query for data much faster using SQL queries, as opposed to reading directly from raw JSON files every time. Although with very efficient speed per repository, there were well over 17 millions events on GitHub that we needed to account for. We agreed that repositories without a certain amount of stars were not worth studying. The challenge was to find the appropriate threshold, which would not take out too many ‘good’ repositories or too few ‘bad’ repositories. The threshold was then decided to be 5 stars. Using a complicated SQL query with a little help of a Stack Overflow user, a table with all the names of the repositories that needed to be checked for Hacker News mention was created.<br><br>
						<img src="http://events.lvtran.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/algolia256x80-ad5c5a658d41ac1dc362d401b73945fb.png" alt="algolia256x80-ad5c5a658d41ac1dc362d401b73945fb" width="256" height="80" style="margin-right:15px; float:left;"/>The next step was simple: iterating over the newly created table and check which repositories were mentioned on Hacker News. To achieve this, we used Hacker News’ Algolia API, which powered their search engine. The API returned standard JSON responses: if the repository was mentioned on Hacker News, we would know about all the posts it appeared in; if not, then the response would be empty. There were a few duplicates for some repositories (i.e more than one Hacker News post mentioned such repositories). We decided to leave out the ‘unimportant’ posts by selecting only the post with the most upvotes. This was done by tweaking the query used for limiting data coming from GitHub.<br><br>At this point, we had enough data to start cross referencing and create our final dataset: a table of all repositories that were mentioned on Hacker News at least once, along with their popularity data for 7 days before and after their date of mention. We would use this table for data visualization, calculating averaged values to make a general conclusion, and providing general, quick statistics about the dataset as a whole.<br><br></p>

						<h3>Visualizing Data</h3>
						<p>We plan to visualize these data using a line chart supported by Google Charts API. The line chart will have 15 points on the x-axis, representing the 7 days before, the day of Hacker News mention date, and the 7 days after. The y-axis will measure the popularity unit, be they the raw number of stars or the daily growth rate. The data obtained will be then transferred to a Google Spreadsheet, from which an HTML displays data queried via JavaScript and Google Queries API. Getting the graphs to display correctly was quite a challenge since we had very limited experience with a front-end language like JavaScript. Nevertheless, we think it is an awesome language to learn in the near future. </p>

					<h2 class="title">Project: Scraping MSN Money</h2>
					<div id="intro"><p>An attempt at learning Python, web scraping, and interpreting financial statements all at once.</p></div>
					<div class="project-descr">
						<h1>Scraping MSN Money</h1>
						<a href=""><img src="http://events.lvtran.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/msnmoney.png" alt="msnmoney" width="333" height="200" style="float:left; margin-right:15px;"/></a>
						<p>I recently picked up my summer reading book, "Warren Buffet and the Interpretation of Financial Statements", by Mary Buffett and David Clark, which basically detailed how Warren Buffett relied on financial statements to decide where to put his money. I am fairly fond of looking over columns of numbers on financial statements, but not so much computing them. I would be more than happy to let a <strong>Python</strong> script do the heavy lifting for me. Through this project, I hope to get better at web scraping and learn a thing or two about reading financial statements.</p>
						<br><p>After searching for "MSN Money API", I was prompted to the quotes report page of Advanced Photonix Inc... There was no API readily available, which inspired the web-scraping aspect of this project. There were quite a few companies to look at, but I started with Apple Inc. ( fan here!). Mary and David mentioned in their book that Warren looked at 3 documents when it comes to picking stocks: the income statements, the balance sheet, and the cash flow. MSN Money had all 3 of these nicely laid out. I would first tackle the income statements. Different companies would have different numbers of reported years, so it was vital that I could capture all the available data.</p>
						<h3>The Income Statement</h3>
						<img src="http://events.lvtran.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-07-15-at-10.39.01-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-07-15 at 10.39.01 AM" width="1000" height="652" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-274" /><p>Thank to the powerful web-interacting library <a href="http://splinter.cobrateam.info/" target="_blank">Splinter</a>, I just needed to find the appropriate CSS tag by inspecting each elements. With Chrome's inspection tool, I saw that all the information I needed only used 3 type of CSS tags, so I used Splinter to query all the elements and categorized them into 3 according lists. After some simple string processing in the Python script, I ended up with an organized string that contained all the information I needed to evaluate a company.</p>
						<table align="center">
						<tr><td>Total revenue</td><td>    Income from selling goods before any deduction</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Cost of revenue</td><td>    Cost of goods sold</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Gross profit</td><td>    Revenue minus cost of revenue</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Profit margin</td><td>    Gross profit to total revenue ratio</td></tr>
						<tr><td>SG&A</td><td>    Selling, general, & admin: Salaries, ads, operating expenses, etc</td></tr>
						<tr><td>R&D</td><td>    Research & development: fund used to innovate</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Operating expenses</td><td>    Cost of running a business</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Operating income</td><td>    Income after depreciation and operating expenses, before interest and tax</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Net interest income&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;            </td><td>    Interest on assets minus interest on liabilities</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Other</td><td>    Misc.</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Pretax income</td><td>    Income after depreciation, operating expenses, interest, before tax</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Net income</td><td>    Income after all deductions (bring-home money)</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Dividend per share</td><td>    How much a shareholder gets paid for each share owned</td></tr>
						</table><br>
						<p>Since I am planning to take a step further by mining all these information for filtering later, I will limit to only a few crucial parts on the Income Statement. There will be a need for an efficient algorithm later on for searching for companies that pass certain constraints (ex: find all companies whose profit margin exceeds 38%).</p>
						<img src="http://events.lvtran.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-07-16-at-10.52.31-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-07-16 at 10.52.31 AM" width="1000" height="1200" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-281" />
						<p>Expecting the data influx from thousands of different companies, I decided to limit the available search categories down to only 'average profit margin' and 'average net income percentage'. These numbers, along with their associated company sticker, were then written to another text file. This alleviated a lot of pressure on searching through thousands of data points, while not sacrificing too much accuracy.</p>

						<h3>The Balance Sheet</h3>
						<p>To be continued.</p>

					<h2 class="title">Project: Dine</h2>
					<div id="intro"><p>The <b><u>1st Place</u></b> Application in a Software Engineering course of 200 students.</p></div>
					<div class="project-descr">
						<h1>Dine</h1>
						<a href=""><img src="http://events.lvtran.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Dine.png" alt="Dine" width="200" height="200" style="margin-right: 15px; float:left;" /></a>
						<p><em>Dine</em> is the result of a 10-week project assigned in CSE 110: Software Engineering, a course at UCSD in which 10 students are put into a team and responsible for a full software development cycle. <em>Dine</em> was voted <b>first place</b> among 19 other competing applications (representing 190 students) for best design, functionality, and presentation. <p>
						<h3>CSE 110: Software Engineering</h3>
						<p>CSE 110 was designed to teach students about software development methodologies (waterfall, agile, scrum, etc), design patterns, design principles (loose coupling, high cohesion, etc) and let them apply these concepts to a hand-on project from scratch. Students functioned just like a typical team in industry: they each had their unique expertise, role, and work style. There were 200 students enrolled at the time I took this course, making up 20 teams, which were then divided into 4 'divisions'. Each week, teams within a division met with our Professor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/gary-gillespie/5/83b/67" target="blank">Gary Gillespie</a> to get his feedback on the current progress. At the end of the 10th week, each team would deliver and present their product. The winner of each division would get to compete with the winners from the other divisions at the final round. Although there was no restriction on the allowed technology, professor Gary asked the teams to stick to the 'restaurant' theme, explaining our appropriate project's name.</p>
						<img src="http://events.lvtran.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IMG_1655.jpg" alt="The Team&#039;s Last Meeting" width="1000" height="667"/>
						<h3>The Team</h3>
						<p>First thing first, I needed a team. I had several friends who were interested in joining, but we only made up half of the required headcount. <a href="http://ankushagrawal.com" target="blank">Ankush A.</a>, one of my close colleagues, was also in the same situation. We joined forces. It was quite convenient because the friends I met through this team also worked with me during hackathons and outside-class projects. Ankush and I were interested in management roles and wanted to put our skills to test, so I expressed my interest in being the <b>Project Manager</b> and Ankush, deputy. We carefully studied each our teammate's expertise and put them into subteams, each responsible for an aspect of the project. The subteams were <strong>Database Team</strong> (Aaron A. & Angelique C.), <strong>Algorithm Team</strong> (Elle. N & Alex T.), <strong>Front-End Software Team</strong> (Josh A. & Brittany F.), and <strong>User Interface Team</strong> (Michelle W. & Kevin T.). Ankush and I spread our effort helping teams that needed extra assistance during different instances of the development process. The intention was that each subteam could function independently without having to wait for others to complete their tasks. For instance, the Algorithm Team just needed to specify what data and structure they wanted to query from the database and the Database Team could proceed with the agreed design. The Database team could work simultaneously without having to wait for the best algorithm to be constructed.</p><a href="http://events.lvtran.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-07-07-at-11.30.13-AM.png" target="blank"><img src="images/team.png" width="1000" height="376"/></a>
						<h3>The App</h3>
						<p>Our team spent the first week deciding the features of our application. Since several members knew iOS programming and I strongly preferred iOS over Android, our team decided to pick iOS as our platform. This decision, as it turned out, gave us a competitive edge over other teams since there were only 2 teams, ourselves included, that developed on iOS. We did not have a name for our application at the time, but we envisioned it to <b>enhance the dining experience</b> (this was our tagline!).</p>
						<img src="http://events.lvtran.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2012-10-25-at-7.41.23-AM.png" alt="Following Pinterest&#039;s More Picture, Less Text Style" width="960" height="864" class="size-full wp-image-211" /> 
						<p>The inspirations for <em>Dine</em> came from a collection of nitty picky problems we personally faced when visiting a restaurant. Whenever I looked at a menu, I would always pick the item that had the most vibrant, standout picture. We thought that if we could replace the paper menu with a digital one that included more (Instagram-quality) pictures and (way) less text, the diners would have a better ordering experience. At first, I wanted to keep our team focused, so I suggested building our application around this core feature. We had already spent countless meetings failing to agree on a set of features to implement, so I thought this approach would make sense.</p>
						<img src="http://events.lvtran.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-07-08-at-10.36.30-AM.png" alt="" width="1000" height="660"/><div style="padding-left: 10%;">Database on Parse Designed by Database Team</div>
						<p>The Database team immediately went to our restaurant of choice, BJ's, website and scrape their entire menu (pictures, price, nutrition facts, descriptions, etc). The data were then structured according to an agreed database schema and stored on <b><a href="http://parse.com">Parse</a></b>. The Front-End Software team could also start to design how the pictures of the menu items would be presented. While waiting for the Database team to get all the pictures and successfully return them (which was a real challenge), the Front-End Software team used dummy data to proceed with their process. They also specified how they wanted to receive their images in a 2D array, giving the Database team a goal to shoot for. Again, each team could function independently without having to wait on each other, preventing delay in development.</p><br>

						<p><br>With the influx of data and the inspiration from <a href="http://events.lvtran.com/lahacks">LA Hacks</a>, we decided to implement a new feature: a meal-randomizer that utilized the iPhone's accelerometer to suggest a random meal combination based on the users' price or calories constraints. Once the user shook their iPhone, the accelerometer would be activated, giving some data which the Algorithm team would then use to determine menu items to suggest. There were well over 100 items on our database, so it was quite a pressure on our algorithm to efficiently search through the database and query appropriate results.</p>
						<img src="http://events.lvtran.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/shake.gif" alt=".

Algorithm Team made searching very efficient</div>
						<p>We were 7 weeks in, but all we had were a really nice menu and a meal generator. Everyone was worried that would not cut it for the competition. This was when I realized holes in my management plan; I should had had a better estimate of what features could be implemented during what time frame. The subteams still did not perfect their tasks; there were too few features; too many artifacts were not updated; not everyone was on the same page with the design the UI team came up with; and then <a href="http://events.lvtran.com/hackuci">HackUCI</a> happened. Team's morale was all time low. I panicked inside. I failed to foresee all these events.</p>
						<img src="http://events.lvtran.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/shake1.gif" alt="Bluetooth on + Close proximity + Beacon simulator = Getting queued! " width="755" height="727" style="margin-left:12%;"/><div style="padding-left: 22%;">Getting queued using Beacon</div>
						<p>I figured the most important thing was to boost morale and regroup. I found a tool called <a href="http://flinto.com">Flinto</a>, which the UI team used to mock up our application with purely PNGs. Ankush and I were on the hunt for new technologies to implement new features. We came across iBeacon and AppLinks. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBeacon" target="blank">iBeacon</a> is a Bluetooth Low Energy device that constantly broadcasts signals, which could be picked up by any iOS 7 device. We immediately thought that we could determine the proximity of the phone with a beacon. After digging the web, we found a beacon simulator, which was essentially an OS X program that utilized the MacBook Pro's Bluetooth chip. We immediately studied this technology and implemented a feature that we call "the Q". Imagine there was a beacon at a reception of a restaurant (simulated by the OS X program in our case), when a user's phone was in close proximity, the application could ask if he/she wanted to be added to the restaurant's queue/waiting list. The user could also check their position on the queue at any point in time.</p>

						<p><a href="http://applinks.org/" target="_blank">AppLinks</a> was a relatively new technology introduced at the Facebook's F8 conference several weeks before. Although there were very little documentation, Ankush and I managed to use AppLinks to implement the payment feature by integrating Venmo. For the first time in iOS, we could seamlessly launch another installed application, Venmo in our case, from our own application.</p>
						<img src="http://events.lvtran.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-07-08-at-11.30.16-PM.png" alt="." width="1000" height="893" class="size-full wp-image-228" /><div style="padding-left: 10%;">Perfect score on implementation test plan</div>
						<p>Things started to fall into place. I was definitely more assertive on the deadlines for each subteam. We had long coding hours most days. By the beginning of week 10, we had successfully put together everything we needed, from the application itself to all the artifacts we documented along the way. While Ankush and I were preparing for the upcoming presentation, we expressed our struggles leading a team of friends and/or apartment-mates. I personally witnessed how disastrous it could have been if I was not more assertive. Learning especially from Ankush and my teammates, I definitely felt more confident in my leadership skill; I learned about the thin line between friends and teammates. If a leadership opportunity arises in the future, I will definitely take on the role and apply what I have acquired from CSE 110 to yield even better results.</p><img src="http://events.lvtran.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-07-08-at-11.32.47-PM.png" alt="Ankush and I presenting at the final presentation." width="1000" height="477" class="size-full wp-image-229" /><div style="padding-left: 10%;">Ankush and I at the final round</div>
						<h3>The Presentation</h3>
						<p>The division round came. We were up against 4 other teams in our division, one of which was the other iOS group. Their application's concept was quite similar to ours. Ankush and I went up to present first; our strategy was setting the expectation bar as high as possible, making our product more memorable. Unfortunately, Ankush and I did not feel like we made a great connection to the audience. The presentation was too button-up, according to our teammates. We managed to pull 40% of the voting pool, though, and entered the final round the week after. Interestingly, there was a tie between 2 teams in another division, resulting in 5 competing teams for the final round. We took our final exam before the presentation; shortly prior to that, we had a chance to chat with our professor Gary, who warned us "the competitions [were] quite steep!". Realizing we were the underdog for this round, Ankush and I put a lot of effort into our presentation. We went first, again, and delivered a more interactive, audience-oriented presentation. While the other 4 teams did a very good job with their projects, we felt like we had a stronger presentation. We pulled a total of 37% of the voting pool; we actually tied first place with another team, who integrated augmented reality technology... However, they fell short during their presentation.</p>
						<img src="http://events.lvtran.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/photo-1.jpg" width="1000" height="750"/><div style="padding-left: 10%;">Our team HIMYM pulled 37% of the votes</div>
						<p>CSE 110 was definitely a breathtaking and emotional ride for me as the Project Manager. I learned and grew with my colleagues. We preserved until the end and brought home a project that we would remember for years to come.</p>

						<p>My name is <b>4</b>, a 19-year-old working toward a Bachelor of Science. I live in La Jolla and am a Chancellor’s Scholar at University of California, San Diego, where I study <b>Computer Science and Business</b>.
						<br><br>I like computers, LEGO’s, and Starbucks. I am fluent in Vietnamese, know a tiny bit of Japanese and Spanish, and also speak Java, Python, C#, C/C++, HTML/CSS, and PHP. My many hobbies include making websites & iOS applications, solving number theory problems on <a style="color: #3399ff;" href="http://www.projecteuler.net">projecteuler.net</a>, reading tech news & investment/finance books, watching <a style="color: #3399ff;" href="http://abc.go.com/shows/shark-tank/">Shark Tank</a> &amp; <a style="color: #3399ff;" href="http://www.nbc.com/the-celebrity-apprentice">The Apprentice</a>, coding, blogging, traveling(!), looking sharp, and making coffee. 
						<br><br>By 2016, I will have obtained my Bachelor's, a solid technical background, an awesome resume (see below!), and a vast, professional network. I am utilizing (almost) every minute of my time working toward this future through internships, research, and course works.</p>
